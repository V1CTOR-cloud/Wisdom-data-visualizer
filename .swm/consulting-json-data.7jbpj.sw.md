# Consume JSON

<br/>

Assign to a constant with **require** function
<!-- NOTE-swimm-snippet: the lines below link your snippet to Swimm -->
### ðŸ“„ data_visualizer/src/views/Landing_view.jsx
```javascript
44     const json1 = require('../data/wisdom/2023-03-06/undefined/1.json');
```

<br/>

Json decoder is needed to separate the Prompt structure into blocks
<!-- NOTE-swimm-snippet: the lines below link your snippet to Swimm -->
### ðŸ“„ data_visualizer/src/views/Landing_view.jsx
```javascript
71     function JsonDecoder(raw_data) {
72         return raw_data.split('\n');
73     }
```

<br/>

Save the string blocks in string array
<!-- NOTE-swimm-snippet: the lines below link your snippet to Swimm -->
### ðŸ“„ data_visualizer/src/views/Landing_view.jsx
```javascript
76         const [trim_data1, set_trim_data1] = useState([]);
```

<br/>

Now you can consume it in your components
<!-- NOTE-swimm-snippet: the lines below link your snippet to Swimm -->
### ðŸ“„ data_visualizer/src/views/Landing_view.jsx
```javascript
240                        <List_component
241                            response={json1.response.text}
242                            questions={json1.propmt.questions}
243                            answers={json1.propmt.answers}
244                            counter={json1.propmt.counter}
245                            init={trim_data1}
246                            prompt={json1.propmt.prompt}
247                            status={json1.response.statusText}
248                            lng={json1.propmt.lng}
249                            start={json1.propmt.start}
250                        />
```
